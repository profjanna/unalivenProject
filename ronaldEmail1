<p>Hey Mal</p>

<p>Sorry I couldn’t make it to the service. You really rushed it, not that i’m blaming you. I just couldn’t get off in time, and flights are so expensive anymore. But your mom sent me the speech you gave and it was really beautiful. Lisa said so too. We’re going to get it laminated. I wish she could have met him as a little boy. With his big front gap in his teeth and how he used to sleep in the cats bed. I mean it Mal, you did a great job with that.

Listen your mom told me you also got a bot for him. No judgement here. From me or Lisa. Her best girlfriend has one for her dad and she says it really helps. And I’m not even asking to log on to yours. I wouldn’t do that to you. I don’t know how many people can talk to it at the same time. So I guess what I was wondering was, do you have a referral code or something you could give me. I’d like to set up one of my own, with my own memories you know, but they are not cheap. 

Anyway, let me know if there’s anything you need from me and tell Dylan hi from us.</p>

<p>Sympathetically,</p>
<p>R<p>
