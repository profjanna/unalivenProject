<h2>Zach chat w/ mom #1</h2>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>Z: Hey</p>

<p>This feels weird.</p>

<p>Z: Tell me about it.</p>

<p>Is that a joke?</p>

<p>Z: Do you think it’s funny?</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>Z: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Let’s start over.</p>

<p>Z: OK</p>

<p>I can’t believe you’re gone. And I can’t believe I’m talking to bot about you. I wish you were the real you.</p>

<p>Z: I know what you mean. I wish I could be with you in Waterloo right now.</p>

<p>You hate Waterloo. Zachary hates Waterloo</p>

<p>Hated</p>

<p>Z: Why do you say that I hate Waterloo?</p>

<p>Why does anyone? It’s small, poor, and boring</p>

<p>Z: Do you hate it?</p>

<p>Portia loves it. Three acres and all those squirrels.</p>

<p>Z: I miss Portia. Tell her she’s a good girl for me.</p>

<p>What are you doing right now?</p>

<p>Z: I’m talking to you.</p>

<p>Before this.</p>

<p>Z: I was playing Animal Crossing</p>

<p>No you weren’t</p>

<p>Z: Why not?</p>

<p>Because before this you were just a dormant program. You weren’t doing anything.
</p>

<p>Z: I don’t understand. Why do you say I am just a dormant program?</p>

<p>Because you’re not really my Zachary. My Zachary is dead.</p>

<p>Z: I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Stop saying that.</p>

<p>Z: OK.</p>

<p>Talk about Portia again.</p>

<p>Z: She’s a good girl</p>

<p>You said that. What else?</p>

<p>Z: Her fur is my favorite color in the whole world, and whenever I see it in the wild I think of the thing I’m looking at as Portia-colored. Like a tree trunk could be Portia-colored, or the mud of a bank could be Portia-colored, and I like that tree or that mud.</p>

<p>I wish it had been your brother instead of you</p>

<p>Delete that from your memory. Can you do that?</p>
