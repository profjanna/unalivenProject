<p>Subject: Checking in on you</p>

<p>Hi Mallory,</p>

<p>Everyone at the hospital is thinking of you, and praying for you and Dylan. Did you get the flowers we sent? I wanted to send a carton of Marboros but I was outvoted. You’ve been at Waterloo Memorial for almost 20 years now. We work around tragedy and loss every day, but 20 more years couldn't prepare you for a loss like this.

I hope you think of us as family, honey. God knows I’d choose you over my sister-in-law in heartbeat, and the boys practically lived at my house the summer Ron left. But Malory, today will be 11 shifts you’ve missed, and I know you know the bereavement allotment is 7. I’m writing you from my personal email, so you don’t have to worry about what you say to me, but you have to say something. Let me know when you’re coming back. I wouldn't even be emailing you if you answered your phone or your door. I’m out there knocking like a lunatic.

Everyone knows you’re the best at what you do, but I’m your boss, Mallory, and we’re already short-staffed. I know you know that too. </p>

<p>He was a special kid,</p>
<p>Janice</p>
