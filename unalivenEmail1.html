<p>Dear Mallory Davis, </p>

<p>Welcome to our Unal:veN family! Thank you so much for being a part of one recent user called a “life changing tool for healing and a beautiful receptacle to help hold digital space for my loved one.” Zachary is in good hands here.

We know you’re offered a number of choices regarding digital afterlife care, so we wanted to give you some information about what we have on offer that makes Unal:ven so unique and special. 

For a limited time, new users can access a trial week of real-time updates for their digitally preserved beloved. This feature adds news content to your griefbot daily so that you can engage them in conversation about the world as it changes for only $24.99. Terms and conditions may apply. 

This month, users can add a celebrity griefbot to their subscription package for a deeply reduced additional cost. Grief isn’t limited to people we knew personally–cultural losses can be real and painful. Process the death of your favorite departed public figure in addition to your beloved for an additional $49.99 a month.

Finally, for those complicated relationships with the lost, we’re offering a deep discount through the end of the month on mediated counseling sessions with your loved one. This service offers a safe space to hash out the arguments you never finished and lets those deep wounds heal for a mere $350.00 per hour long session, compared to AfterLife’s similar service priced at nearly twice that amount. 

 </p>

<p>We’re here for your healing.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Unal:veN Team</p>
